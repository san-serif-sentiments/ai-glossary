## Short definition
Cross-functional committee that approves high-risk AI launches and monitors mitigations.

## Long definition
A safety review board brings together policy, legal, security, product, and engineering leaders to evaluate AI systems before deployment. The board reviews risk registers, assurance cases, evaluation results, and mitigation plans, then issues approvals or action items. It also monitors incidents, tracks mitigation follow-through, and ensures governance policies evolve with capabilities. Effective boards maintain charters, meeting cadences, and decision logs that feed back into assurance cases and executive reporting. Without a formal board, decisions may be made piecemeal, leaving organizations exposed to fragmented oversight and inconsistent accountability.

## Audience perspectives
- **Exec:** Empower a safety board with decision rights so responsibility for high-risk launches is explicit.
- **Engineer:** Prepare evidence packages that address the board’s checklist and document follow-ups.

## Examples
**Do**
- Publish a charter defining scope, membership, and escalation paths.
- Record decisions and rationale to inform future reviews.

**Don't**
- Treat approvals as rubber stamps without requiring evidence of mitigations.
- Leave the board uninformed about production incidents.

## Governance
- **NIST RMF tags:** governance, accountability, risk_management
- **Risk notes:** Absent governance bodies, high-severity decisions can bypass oversight and create liability.

## Relationships
- **Broader:** model governance
- **Related:** assurance case, risk register, impact mitigation plan
