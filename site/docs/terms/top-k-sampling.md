# top-k sampling

**Aliases:** k-sampling, truncated sampling
**Categories:** LLM Core
**Roles:** Data Science & Research, Engineering & Platform, Product & Program Managers
**Part of speech:** `process`
**Status:** `draft` (Last reviewed: 2024-11-01)

## Short definition
Decoding method that samples from the k most probable next tokens to balance diversity and control.

## Long definition
Top-k sampling limits the candidate set during generation to the k tokens with the highest probabilities after applying the modelâ€™s softmax distribution. By discarding the long tail of unlikely options, the technique keeps outputs coherent while preserving some variability relative to greedy decoding. Product teams use top-k to tune tone and creativity without inviting the unrestricted randomness of pure sampling. Engineers choose k values based on experimentation with validation prompts, often combining the method with temperature scaling or nucleus sampling to fine-tune randomness. Operationally, top-k is simple to implement and deterministic when paired with fixed seeds, which supports reproducibility requirements. Governance reviewers document chosen k values because they affect the likelihood of unsafe or off-policy responses; overly permissive settings can undo safety evaluations performed at lower k thresholds. As part of responsible deployment, teams monitor how k adjustments interact with guardrails, cost, and quality metrics across releases.

## Audience perspectives
- **Exec:** A knob that keeps the model creative but still focused on the best few answers.
- **Engineer:** Truncate the probability distribution to the highest-probability k tokens before sampling to manage diversity versus determinism.

## Examples
**Do**
- Evaluate customer support flows at k=1, 10, and 40 to understand trade-offs in tone and accuracy.

**Don't**
- Increase k in production without rerunning safety and bias evaluations.

## Governance
- **NIST RMF tags:** robustness, transparency
- **Risk notes:** Raising k expands behavioral variance and can expose users to unreviewed content patterns.

## Relationships
- **Broader:** decoding
- **Related:** temperature, top-p sampling, greedy decoding
