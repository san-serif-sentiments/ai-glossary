# responsible ai

**Aliases:** trustworthy ai, ethical ai
**Categories:** Governance & Risk
**Roles:** Communications & Enablement, Legal & Compliance, Policy & Risk, Product & Program Managers
**Part of speech:** `concept`
**Status:** `draft` (Last reviewed: 2024-11-01)

## Short definition
Frameworks and practices that ensure AI systems are safe, fair, and aligned with ethical and legal expectations.

## Long definition
Responsible AI encompasses the policies, technical controls, and cultural norms that guide how AI is built and deployed. It integrates principles such as fairness, transparency, accountability, privacy, and security into each phase of the model lifecycle. Organizations operationalize responsible AI through governance committees, risk assessments, red teaming, documentation standards, and inclusive design processes. Engineering teams implement safeguards like guardrails, evaluation suites, and monitoring to enforce these principles. Product and legal leaders translate regulatory requirements and stakeholder expectations into practical guardrails and disclosures. Responsible AI is not a single project but an ongoing discipline that adapts as technology and regulations evolve. By grounding innovations in responsible AI, organizations increase user trust, reduce liability, and create sustainable value.

## Audience perspectives
- **Exec:** Responsible AI ensures innovation progresses with safeguards that protect people and the business.
- **Engineer:** Embed fairness, safety, privacy, and accountability into data, model, and deployment workflows.

## Examples
**Do**
- Include responsible AI reviews in the release checklist for every high-impact feature.

**Don't**
- Treat responsible AI as a post-launch audit instead of a lifecycle commitment.

## Governance
- **NIST RMF tags:** risk_management, accountability
- **Risk notes:** Ignoring responsible AI principles invites regulatory action, reputational harm, and inequitable outcomes.

## Relationships
- **Broader:** artificial intelligence
- **Narrower:** model governance, alignment, guardrails
- **Related:** red teaming, evaluation, privacy
