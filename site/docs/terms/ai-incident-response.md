# ai incident response

**Aliases:** model incident response, ai escalation
**Categories:** Operations & Monitoring, Governance & Risk
**Roles:** Communications & Enablement, Engineering & Platform, Legal & Compliance, Policy & Risk, Product & Program Managers, Security & Trust
**Part of speech:** `process`
**Status:** <span class="status-chip status-approved">Approved</span> (Last reviewed: 2025-09-29)

## Role takeaways
- **Communications & Enablement:** Align messaging, FAQs, and enablement materials using this definition.
- **Engineering & Platform:** Document implementation requirements and operational caveats.
- **Legal & Compliance:** Assess contractual and regulatory obligations tied to this term.
- **Policy & Risk:** Map the definition to governance controls and review checklists.
- **Product & Program Managers:** Translate this concept into user impact and rollout plans.
- **Security & Trust:** Plan monitoring and abuse prevention scenarios influenced by this term.

## Practice & apply
- Instrument dashboards or alerts that reflect the metrics highlighted in this definition.
- Update incident response or on-call runbooks with the glossary's do/don't scenarios.
- Map this term to the governance dashboard and record accountable owners in the backlog.
- Review current regulatory guidance or internal policy notes linked from the resources page before sign-off.
- Share takeaways with the accountable roles listed above so actions land with the right owners.

## Short definition
Coordinated workflow for detecting, triaging, and remediating harmful or out-of-policy AI behavior.

## Long definition
AI incident response adapts traditional incident management to the unique risks of machine learning systems. It defines how teams detect unusual behavior, declare incidents, assemble cross-functional responders, communicate with stakeholders, and deploy mitigations or rollbacks. Triggers include safety violations, hallucinations with material impact, security breaches, or regulatory inquiries. Effective programs maintain runbooks that cover data isolation, prompt freezes, feature flags, and guardrail adjustments. Product, engineering, legal, and communications partners collaborate to assess severity, user impact, and reporting obligations. Governance frameworks expect documented incident response procedures with clear owners and timelines, particularly for high-risk deployments. After-action reviews capture learnings that feed back into evaluation suites, prompts, and monitoring. Without a disciplined incident response plan, organizations risk delayed containment, regulatory penalties, and erosion of user trust.

## Audience perspectives
- **Exec:** AI incident response is the playbook that keeps harm contained and stakeholders informed when something goes wrong.
- **Engineer:** Detect anomalies, page the on-call rotation, freeze risky components, and coordinate fixes across data, model, and infra teams.

## Examples
**Do**
- Run quarterly tabletop exercises to rehearse AI incident response workflows.

**Don't**
- Silence alerts or skip postmortems once an incident is closed.

## Governance
- **NIST RMF tags:** risk_management, accountability
- **Risk notes:** Lack of documented response plans prolongs harmful behavior and undermines regulatory reporting.

## Relationships
- **Broader:** model governance
- **Related:** red teaming, guardrails, ml observability
