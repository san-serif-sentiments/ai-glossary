# model governance

**Aliases:** ai governance, ml governance
**Categories:** Governance & Risk
**Roles:** Communications & Enablement, Legal & Compliance, Policy & Risk, Product & Program Managers
**Part of speech:** `concept`
**Status:** <span class="status-chip status-approved">Approved</span> (Last reviewed: 2025-09-29)

## Role takeaways
- **Communications & Enablement:** Align messaging, FAQs, and enablement materials using this definition.
- **Legal & Compliance:** Assess contractual and regulatory obligations tied to this term.
- **Policy & Risk:** Map the definition to governance controls and review checklists.
- **Product & Program Managers:** Translate this concept into user impact and rollout plans.

## Practice & apply
- Map this term to the governance dashboard and record accountable owners in the backlog.
- Review current regulatory guidance or internal policy notes linked from the resources page before sign-off.
- Share takeaways with the accountable roles listed above so actions land with the right owners.

## Short definition
Policies and processes that manage AI models across risk, compliance, and lifecycle decisions.

## Long definition
Model governance coordinates legal, risk, engineering, and product roles to oversee how AI systems are developed, deployed, and maintained. Core activities include documenting intended use, validating data sources, approving releases, monitoring for drift, and managing incidents. Governance frameworks—such as the NIST AI RMF or ISO/IEC standards—expect organizations to maintain traceability for models, prompts, datasets, and evaluation evidence. Committees or designated owners review changes, enforce segregation of duties, and ensure audits can reconstruct decisions. Product teams rely on governance guardrails to align with policy, while engineers integrate governance checkpoints into ML Ops pipelines. Without governance, AI initiatives accumulate technical debt, expose companies to regulatory penalties, and erode user trust. Mature governance balances innovation with accountability, enabling responsible scaling of AI capabilities.

## Audience perspectives
- **Exec:** Model governance keeps AI programs aligned with policy, compliance, and stakeholder expectations as they scale.
- **Engineer:** Define ownership, documentation, approvals, and monitoring requirements so every model change is auditable.

## Examples
**Do**
- Record decision logs and reviewers for each production model release.

**Don't**
- Deploy models without documenting purpose, controls, and evaluation results.

## Governance
- **NIST RMF tags:** accountability, risk_management
- **Risk notes:** Absent governance leads to untracked risks, inconsistent controls, and regulatory exposure.

## Relationships
- **Broader:** responsible ai
- **Narrower:** ml ops, model drift, ai incident response
- **Related:** evaluation, alignment, guardrails
