# incident taxonomy

**Aliases:** incident classification, risk taxonomy
**Categories:** Operations & Monitoring
**Roles:** Policy & Risk, Security & Trust, Product & Program Managers, Engineering & Platform
**Part of speech:** `noun_phrase`
**Status:** <span class="status-chip status-approved">Approved</span> (Last reviewed: 2025-09-29)

## Role takeaways
- **Policy & Risk:** Map the definition to governance controls and review checklists.
- **Security & Trust:** Plan monitoring and abuse prevention scenarios influenced by this term.
- **Product & Program Managers:** Translate this concept into user impact and rollout plans.
- **Engineering & Platform:** Document implementation requirements and operational caveats.

## Practice & apply
- Instrument dashboards or alerts that reflect the metrics highlighted in this definition.
- Update incident response or on-call runbooks with the glossary's do/don't scenarios.
- Share takeaways with the accountable roles listed above so actions land with the right owners.

## Short definition
Standardized categories used to tag, analyze, and report AI incidents consistently.

## Long definition
An incident taxonomy defines the categories and severity levels used when logging AI failures or near misses. It enables consistent reporting across teams, trend analysis, and regulatory submissions. The taxonomy should map to policy commitments (e.g., privacy, bias, safety), specify severity criteria, and align with incident response playbooks. Policy teams maintain the taxonomy, engineering and support staff apply it during postmortems, and executives use the data to prioritize mitigations. Without a shared taxonomy, incident data becomes noisy, making it difficult to learn from patterns or demonstrate accountability to regulators.

## Audience perspectives
- **Exec:** Mandate taxonomy usage so incident trends inform roadmap and governance decisions.
- **Engineer:** Tag incidents accurately and link them to the taxonomy when filing postmortems.

## Examples
**Do**
- Review taxonomy definitions annually with policy and security stakeholders.
- Tie mitigation backlog items to taxonomy categories for tracking.

**Don't**
- Let teams create ad hoc categories that fragment reporting.
- Ignore low-severity categories; they often reveal emerging risks.

## Governance
- **NIST RMF tags:** governance, monitoring, accountability
- **Risk notes:** Inconsistent classification hides systemic issues and complicates regulatory disclosure.

## Relationships
- **Broader:** ai incident response
- **Related:** risk register, impact mitigation plan, transparency report
