# ai circuit breaker

**Aliases:** kill switch, automated shutdown
**Categories:** Operations & Monitoring
**Roles:** Engineering & Platform, Security & Trust, Policy & Risk, Product & Program Managers
**Part of speech:** `noun_phrase`
**Status:** <span class="status-chip status-approved">Approved</span> (Last reviewed: 2025-09-29)

## Role takeaways
- **Engineering & Platform:** Document implementation requirements and operational caveats.
- **Security & Trust:** Plan monitoring and abuse prevention scenarios influenced by this term.
- **Policy & Risk:** Map the definition to governance controls and review checklists.
- **Product & Program Managers:** Translate this concept into user impact and rollout plans.

## Practice & apply
- Instrument dashboards or alerts that reflect the metrics highlighted in this definition.
- Update incident response or on-call runbooks with the glossary's do/don't scenarios.
- Share takeaways with the accountable roles listed above so actions land with the right owners.

## Short definition
Automated control that halts model responses or tool access when risk thresholds are exceeded.

## Long definition
An AI circuit breaker detects abnormal behavior—such as rapid policy violations, runaway tool use, or anomalous telemetry—and stops the system from continuing without human approval. It can disable outputs, revoke tool permissions, or route all traffic to human agents. Security and engineering teams design detection logic, policy leaders set thresholds, and product teams coordinate user messaging. Circuit breakers complement escalation policies and incident response plans, providing a fast path to contain harm. Without them, incidents may escalate faster than humans can intervene manually.

## Audience perspectives
- **Exec:** Mandate circuit breakers for high-impact automations to cap worst-case scenarios.
- **Engineer:** Log activations, reasons, and resolution notes so the control remains auditable.

## Examples
**Do**
- Trigger a breaker if safety classifiers flag repeated violations within a session.
- Simulate breaker events during chaos exercises to ensure recovery paths work.

**Don't**
- Leave breaker logic undocumented or dependent on a single engineer.
- Ignore alerts after a breaker fires; reset only after root cause analysis.

## Governance
- **NIST RMF tags:** risk_management, monitoring, security
- **Risk notes:** Without emergency stops, AI incidents can cause cascading harm before humans respond.

## Relationships
- **Broader:** ai incident response
- **Related:** escalation policy, safety classifier, guardrail policy
