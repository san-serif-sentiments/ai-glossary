# data redaction

**Aliases:** pii redaction, sensitive data masking
**Categories:** Governance & Risk
**Roles:** Engineering & Platform, Policy & Risk, Legal & Compliance, Security & Trust
**Part of speech:** `process`
**Status:** <span class="status-chip status-reviewed">Reviewed</span> (Last reviewed: 2025-09-28)

## Role takeaways
- **Engineering & Platform:** Document implementation requirements and operational caveats.
- **Policy & Risk:** Map the definition to governance controls and review checklists.
- **Legal & Compliance:** Assess contractual and regulatory obligations tied to this term.
- **Security & Trust:** Plan monitoring and abuse prevention scenarios influenced by this term.

## Practice & apply
- Map this term to the governance dashboard and record accountable owners in the backlog.
- Review current regulatory guidance or internal policy notes linked from the resources page before sign-off.
- Share takeaways with the accountable roles listed above so actions land with the right owners.

## Short definition
Removal or masking of sensitive fields before data is stored, shared, or used for model training.

## Long definition
Data redaction removes or obfuscates sensitive information—such as personal identifiers, secrets, or confidential business details—before data is logged, retrained, or surfaced to analysts. Techniques include masking, hashing, token substitution, and selective deletion. Policy and legal teams define what must be redacted, engineers implement automated pipelines, and security verifies effectiveness through sampling and audits. Mature programs document redaction effectiveness, expose dashboards to auditors, and tie results to incident response drills. Redaction protects privacy, reduces breach impact, and supports compliance with consent and retention requirements. Incomplete redaction can leak sensitive information into training data or logs.

## Audience perspectives
- **Exec:** Require automated redaction in telemetry and training pipelines to reduce regulatory exposure.
- **Engineer:** Build redaction into ingestion pipelines and confirm outputs with monitoring.

## Examples
**Do**
- Redact PII at the edge before persisting chat transcripts.
- Track redaction effectiveness with periodic manual reviews.

**Don't**
- Rely solely on manual processes to strip sensitive data.
- Redact without documenting which fields are affected, confusing downstream users.

## Governance
- **NIST RMF tags:** privacy, risk_management, security
- **Risk notes:** Poor redaction leaks sensitive data into models, logs, or analytics workflows.

## Relationships
- **Broader:** data minimization
- **Related:** consent management, data retention, privacy impact assessment
