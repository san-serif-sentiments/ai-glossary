# dataset card

**Aliases:** dataset documentation, data sheet
**Categories:** Governance & Risk
**Roles:** Data Science & Research, Policy & Risk, Legal & Compliance, Product & Program Managers
**Part of speech:** `noun_phrase`
**Status:** <span class="status-chip status-reviewed">Reviewed</span> (Last reviewed: 2025-09-28)

## Role takeaways
- **Data Science & Research:** Incorporate the metric or method into evaluation pipelines.
- **Policy & Risk:** Map the definition to governance controls and review checklists.
- **Legal & Compliance:** Assess contractual and regulatory obligations tied to this term.
- **Product & Program Managers:** Translate this concept into user impact and rollout plans.

## Practice & apply
- Map this term to the governance dashboard and record accountable owners in the backlog.
- Review current regulatory guidance or internal policy notes linked from the resources page before sign-off.
- Share takeaways with the accountable roles listed above so actions land with the right owners.

## Short definition
Structured documentation describing a dataset’s purpose, composition, risks, and usage constraints.

## Long definition
A dataset card records how and why data was collected, what populations it represents, known biases, licensing, and recommended uses. Inspired by model cards and “datasheets for datasets,” the card gives reviewers the context needed to judge fitness for training or evaluation. Data scientists author technical details, policy and legal teams capture risk considerations, and product teams reference the card when scoping features. Keeping cards up to date enables auditors to trace claims back to source data and supports transparency commitments.

## Audience perspectives
- **Exec:** Require dataset cards before approving new training data to avoid surprises later.
- **Engineer:** Link data pipelines and model training jobs back to the referenced card for traceability.

## Examples
**Do**
- Document demographic coverage, labeling processes, and known limitations.
- Include contact points for questions or takedown requests.

**Don't**
- Publish datasets without clarifying licensing or consent status.
- Let cards drift after significant data updates.

## Governance
- **NIST RMF tags:** transparency, governance, accountability
- **Risk notes:** Missing documentation obscures bias, licensing, and consent concerns tied to data.

## Relationships
- **Broader:** model governance
- **Related:** model card, consent management, transparency report
