# privacy budget

**Aliases:** epsilon budget, differential privacy budget
**Categories:** Governance & Risk
**Roles:** Data Science & Research, Policy & Risk, Legal & Compliance, Engineering & Platform
**Part of speech:** `noun_phrase`
**Status:** <span class="status-chip status-approved">Approved</span> (Last reviewed: 2025-09-29)

## Role takeaways
- **Data Science & Research:** Incorporate the metric or method into evaluation pipelines.
- **Policy & Risk:** Map the definition to governance controls and review checklists.
- **Legal & Compliance:** Assess contractual and regulatory obligations tied to this term.
- **Engineering & Platform:** Document implementation requirements and operational caveats.

## Practice & apply
- Map this term to the governance dashboard and record accountable owners in the backlog.
- Review current regulatory guidance or internal policy notes linked from the resources page before sign-off.
- Share takeaways with the accountable roles listed above so actions land with the right owners.

## Short definition
Quantitative limit on how much privacy loss is allowed when applying differential privacy.

## Long definition
A privacy budget sets the maximum cumulative privacy loss (often parameterized by epsilon) that an organization will tolerate when querying or training with differentially private mechanisms. Each query or training run consumes part of the budget, so teams must track usage and halt processing when the limit is reached. Policy and legal leaders define acceptable thresholds, data scientists monitor consumption, and engineers enforce the budget in pipelines. Without budget tracking, repeated queries can quietly degrade privacy guarantees beyond regulatory or ethical bounds.

## Audience perspectives
- **Exec:** Treat the privacy budget as a compliance control that requires monitoring and governance.
- **Engineer:** Instrument analytics and training jobs to decrement the budget automatically and alert owners.

## Examples
**Do**
- Document initial and remaining epsilon values alongside each release.
- Aggregate similar queries to conserve budget and reduce risk.

**Don't**
- Ignore budget depletion warnings for critical user data.
- Share raw event logs when the privacy budget reaches zero.

## Governance
- **NIST RMF tags:** privacy, risk_management, governance
- **Risk notes:** Overrunning the budget invalidates differential privacy claims and increases legal exposure.

## Relationships
- **Broader:** differential privacy
- **Related:** data minimization, consent management, risk register
