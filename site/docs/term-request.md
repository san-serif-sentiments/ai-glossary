# Term Request Intake

Help us capture confusing AI vocabulary quickly without overwhelming employees.

## How to submit a request
1. Open the short form at `[Replace with internal URL]` from any device.
2. Spend two minutes filling in the fields below—plain language is perfect.
3. Expect a response within five business days; we will confirm whether the term joins the backlog or if we need more context.

> Tip: if you prefer email or chat, copy the question set into your message so everyone shares the same details.

## Form questions (copy/paste into your tool of choice)
- **Your name and team** – we reach out if we need clarifications.
- **Term or phrase** – what needs defining? Include common aliases if you know them.
- **Where you saw it** – meeting, customer call, policy doc, etc.
- **Why it matters** – describe the task you were trying to finish when the term caused friction.
- **Audience impact** – who else might struggle (engineers, sales, legal, executives)?
- **Urgency** – now, this quarter, or evergreen? Helps prioritize the backlog.
- **Helpful links** – optional articles, specs, or policy notes to review.

Keep the form mobile-friendly: short labels, sentence-case instructions, and confirmation copy that thanks the requester for their help.

## What happens next
- Requests feed into the [keyword backlog](keyword-backlog/) during the weekly triage review.
- We tag each item with a cluster and owner, then update the status column so submitters can check progress.
- When a term ships, we notify the requester and link to the published page.

## Accessibility and UX considerations
- Use large touch targets and 16px+ text if you build the form on the intranet.
- Offer alternative submission paths (Slack message, email) for colleagues using assistive tech.
- Provide a confirmation message that restates the submitted term and next steps in plain language.
- Store responses in a shared folder so contributors can spot patterns without re-asking employees.

A lightweight form plus transparent follow-up keeps the glossary grounded in real employee needs while preventing information overload.
