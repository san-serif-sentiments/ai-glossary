  Privacy in AI systems focuses on controlling how personal or sensitive data is collected, processed, and retained. Regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, and sector-specific laws establish legal obligations for transparency, consent, minimization, and user rights. In machine learning, privacy risks arise from training data, prompts, logs, and model outputs that may reveal personal information. Teams mitigate these risks through data minimization, access controls, anonymization, synthetic data, and privacy-enhancing technologies like differential privacy. Product leaders coordinate privacy reviews with legal counsel when launching new features, while engineers implement safeguards in data pipelines, storage, and logging. Governance programs track privacy impact assessments, retention schedules, and incident response plans. Maintaining rigorous privacy practices preserves user trust and avoids regulatory penalties, making it a foundational requirement for responsible AI deployments.
