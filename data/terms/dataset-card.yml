  A dataset card records how and why data was collected, what populations it represents, known biases, licensing, and
  recommended uses. Inspired by model cards and “datasheets for datasets,” the card gives reviewers the context needed to
  judge fitness for training or evaluation. Data scientists author technical details, policy and legal teams capture risk
  considerations, and product teams reference the card when scoping features. Keeping cards up to date enables auditors to
  trace claims back to source data and supports transparency commitments.
