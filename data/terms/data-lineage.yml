  Data lineage maps the lifecycle of data from ingestion through processing, training, evaluation, and deployment. It
  records sources, transformations, storage locations, and downstream consumers so teams can audit usage, troubleshoot
  quality issues, and respond to regulatory requests. Engineering automates lineage capture in pipelines, data scientists
  log transformations in notebooks, and policy teams use lineage to verify compliance with consent and retention rules.
  Effective lineage feeds governance dashboards, reminds owners to retire obsolete datasets, and documents which models
  rely on each asset. Without lineage, it is difficult to honor deletion requests, explain model behavior, or investigate
  incidents.
audiences:
  exec: "Treat lineage as foundational infrastructure for audit readiness and trust."
  engineer: "Instrument pipelines to emit lineage metadata and expose it via searchable catalogs."
examples:
  do:
    - "Link training datasets to their upstream sources and associated dataset cards."
    - "Tag lineage records with retention and consent attributes."
  dont:
    - "Rely on tribal knowledge to track where sensitive data flows."
    - "Break lineage chains when copying data to ad hoc storage."

    - "accountability"
