  Consent management ensures AI systems only process data in ways users or data subjects have authorized. It covers how
  organizations collect consent, represent it in data pipelines, respect withdrawal requests, and surface disclosures in
  product experiences. Legal and policy teams define the consent taxonomy, product teams design user flows, and
  engineers propagate consent flags through storage, training, and inference systems. Mature programs monitor for drift
  and provide regulators with evidence that consent was honored. Weak consent management risks privacy violations,
  regulatory fines, and erosion of customer trust.
