  The target variable is the reference output used to evaluate model predictions during training and testing. In supervised
  learning it represents ground truth labels, such as fraud or not fraud, estimated price, or safety category. Accurate,
  consistent targets allow teams to compute loss functions, track metrics like precision and recall, and align models with
  business objectives. Product stakeholders define which real-world outcome matters most, while engineers and data
  scientists maintain labeling pipelines, quality checks, and access controls. Poorly governed targets undermine evaluation
  integrity and can encode bias, leading to misinformed decisions at launch.
audiences:
  exec: "The target variable is the result we ask the model to get right so business decisions stay grounded."
  engineer: "Keep labeling guidelines versioned, audit quality, and map targets to downstream KPIs before training."
examples:
  do:
    - "Review labeling consistency across vendors before starting a new training run."
    - "Document how targets map to customer outcomes in the model card."
  dont:
    - "Mix labels from incompatible taxonomies without reconciliation."
    - "Expose sensitive targets to broad teams without privacy controls."
