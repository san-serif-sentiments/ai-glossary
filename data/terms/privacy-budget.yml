short_def: "Quantitative limit on how much privacy loss is allowed when applying differential privacy."
long_def: >-
  A privacy budget sets the maximum cumulative privacy loss (often parameterized by epsilon) that an organization will
  tolerate when querying or training with differentially private mechanisms. Each query or training run consumes part of
  the budget, so teams must track usage and halt processing when the limit is reached. Policy and legal leaders define
  acceptable thresholds, data scientists monitor consumption, and engineers enforce the budget in pipelines. Without
  budget tracking, repeated queries can quietly degrade privacy guarantees beyond regulatory or ethical bounds.
audiences:
  exec: "Treat the privacy budget as a compliance control that requires monitoring and governance."
  engineer: "Instrument analytics and training jobs to decrement the budget automatically and alert owners."
examples:
  do:
    - "Document initial and remaining epsilon values alongside each release."
    - "Aggregate similar queries to conserve budget and reduce risk."
  dont:
    - "Ignore budget depletion warnings for critical user data."
    - "Share raw event logs when the privacy budget reaches zero."
