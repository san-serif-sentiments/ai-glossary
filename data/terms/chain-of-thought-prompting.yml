  Chain-of-thought prompting instructs a model to show its reasoning by generating step-by-step explanations. The extra
  reasoning tokens often improve accuracy on tasks like math, code, and logic by encouraging deliberate thinking.
  Engineers use chain-of-thought to debug and audit reasoning, while policy teams review steps for safety or bias. Product
  teams decide when to expose the chain to end users versus using it internally for verification. The technique increases
  latency and risk of leaking sensitive reasoning, so outputs must still be checked by evaluations or secondary models.
audiences:
  exec: "Apply chain-of-thought selectively where explainability or reasoning accuracy matters most."
  engineer: "Pair reasoning traces with validators to catch hallucinated logic or policy violations."
examples:
  do:
    - "Prompt models with `Let's reason step by step` for complex calculations."
    - "Filter intermediate reasoning before displaying responses to end users."
  dont:
    - "Assume longer reasoning always means higher accuracy."
    - "Expose sensitive internal policies in reasoning traces."
