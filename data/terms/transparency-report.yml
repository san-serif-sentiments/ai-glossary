long_def: >-
  A transparency report is a structured publication that explains how an AI system was built, deployed, and governed.
  It typically documents training data provenance, safety mitigations, evaluation outcomes, incidents, and law-enforcement
  or policy interactions. Regulators increasingly require providers to publish these reports on a fixed cadence, while
  enterprises use them to demonstrate accountability to customers and civil society. Effective reports pair quantitative
  metrics with narrative context so stakeholders can understand both capabilities and limitations. Policy and legal teams
  coordinate the disclosure scope, communications tailors the narrative, and product owners provide operational detail.
  Without disciplined reporting, organizations struggle to prove compliance, respond to audits, or build trust with users.
audiences:
  exec: "Use transparency reports to show regulators and customers that your AI program meets accountability expectations."
