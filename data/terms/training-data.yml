  Training data is the portion of the dataset used to fit model parameters. These examples expose the algorithm to the
  signals it should internalize, from class boundaries to feature interactions. High-quality training data mirrors the
  production environment, includes the right balance of cohorts, and has documented provenance so teams can trace issues.
  Engineers tune hyperparameters and optimization steps against this split, while product partners track which customer or
  policy scenarios are represented. Weak training data leads to brittle models that memorize quirks rather than patterns,
  increasing the odds of bias, regressions, and governance failures when the system is deployed.
audiences:
  exec: 'Training data is the fuel that teaches the model what "good" looks like before launch.'
  engineer: "Curate representative, versioned examples with clear labels; document preprocessing and access controls."
examples:
  do:
    - "Record data lineage and consent before moving samples into the training set."
    - "Refresh training data when product usage, markets, or regulations shift."
  dont:
    - "Mix evaluation samples back into training without resetting benchmark baselines."
    - "Ignore gaps in protected classes or edge scenarios that appear in production."
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
    - "data_quality"
    - "transparency"
  risk_notes: "Poorly governed training data creates hidden bias and auditing gaps that surface as fairness or compliance incidents."
