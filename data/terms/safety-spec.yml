  A safety spec translates high-level AI principles into actionable guidance for a specific system. It enumerates desired behaviours, prohibited outputs, escalation paths, and fallback actions across scenarios such as self-harm, misinformation, sensitive topics, or abuse. Product and policy teams draft the intent; engineering and safety specialists convert it into prompts, classifiers, guardrails, and monitoring hooks; communications teams prepare messaging for when guardrails trigger. A good safety spec links each requirement to reference examples, evaluation suites, and human review steps, so updates can be tested before deployment. The document is version-controlled alongside prompts and model configs, and is revisited after incidents, red teaming, or regulatory changes. Without a safety spec, expectations stay tribal, handoffs break down, and teams cannot prove alignment with industry or statutory obligations.
audiences:
  exec: "Shows how we operationalise safety promises with concrete rules, owners, and escalation paths."
  engineer: "Clarifies what the model must block or escalate and how to wire guardrails, logging, and overrides."
examples:
  do:
    - "Version-control the safety spec and require sign-off from policy, legal, and engineering before shipping changes."
    - "Attach evaluation prompts and datasets that must pass before releasing a new prompt or model checkpoint."
  dont:
    - "Copy a generic policy without adding concrete prompts, thresholds, or handoff procedures."
    - "Let the safety spec drift after incidents—update the rules and tests while lessons are fresh."
