short_def: "Final evaluation split reserved for measuring real-world performance after all model tuning is finished."
long_def: >-
  The test set acts as the last line of defense before deployment. Once training and validation are complete, teams use this
  untouched data slice to estimate how a model will behave in production. Because it reflects realistic scenarios and has
  never influenced tuning decisions, the test set provides credible evidence for governance reviews, model cards, and launch
  approvals. Product owners study test outcomes to understand business impact, while engineers compare historical test set
  runs to spot regressions or drift. Strict separation from training and validation data, coupled with version control and
  documented refresh policies, preserves trust in test results.
audiences:
  exec: "The test set is our final validation that the model keeps its promises before customers see it."
  engineer: "Protect the test set from reuse, track baseline metrics over time, and rotate it only with formal approvals."
examples:
  do:
    - "Store multiple generations of test sets so you can benchmark new models against historical baselines."
    - "Capture subgroup metrics and qualitative notes during every test run for audit trails."
  dont:
    - "Peek at the test set to choose hyperparameters or feature engineering steps."
    - "Reuse the same test set indefinitely without monitoring for stale scenarios."
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
    - "validity"
    - "accountability"
  risk_notes: "Compromised test sets hide regressions and undercut the evidence required for responsible AI approvals."
