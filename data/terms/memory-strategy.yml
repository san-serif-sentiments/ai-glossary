  A memory strategy defines how an AI agent captures, retrieves, and expires contextual information while executing
  tasks. It balances cost, latency, privacy, and safety considerations by deciding which events to persist, where to
  store them, and which signals trigger deletion. Engineers design memory policies to avoid stale or sensitive data
  leaking into future prompts, while product teams ensure the experience remains transparent to users. Common patterns
  include stateless execution, short-term scratchpads, vector memory with embeddings, and human-curated summaries. The
  right strategy depends on regulatory constraints, user consent, and the risk tolerance for hallucinations or runaway
  tool use. Without clear guardrails, agents can over-collect data, misapply outdated facts, or introduce compliance gaps.
audiences:
  exec: "Align on what information the agent keeps so you can set customer trust and compliance expectations."
  engineer: "Codify storage tiers, retention windows, and redaction rules before wiring memory into agent workflows."
examples:
  do:
    - "Expire vector memories that include personally identifiable information within 24 hours unless explicit consent exists."
    - "Store only structured summaries of previous steps so downstream prompts stay within token and privacy budgets."
  dont:
    - "Persist raw chat transcripts indefinitely without auditing for sensitive attributes."
    - "Reuse memories from one customer tenant inside another tenant's session."
