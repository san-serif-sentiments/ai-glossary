long_def: >-
  Data redaction removes or obfuscates sensitive information—such as personal identifiers, secrets, or confidential
  business details—before data is logged, retrained, or surfaced to analysts. Techniques include masking, hashing, token
  substitution, and selective deletion. Policy and legal teams define what must be redacted, engineers implement automated
  pipelines, and security verifies effectiveness through sampling and audits. Mature programs document redaction
  effectiveness, expose dashboards to auditors, and tie results to incident response drills. Redaction protects privacy,
  reduces breach impact, and supports compliance with consent and retention requirements. Incomplete redaction can leak
  sensitive information into training data or logs.
audiences:
  exec: "Require automated redaction in telemetry and training pipelines to reduce regulatory exposure."
  engineer: "Build redaction into ingestion pipelines and confirm outputs with monitoring."
examples:
  do:
    - "Redact PII at the edge before persisting chat transcripts."
    - "Track redaction effectiveness with periodic manual reviews."
  dont:
    - "Rely solely on manual processes to strip sensitive data."
    - "Redact without documenting which fields are affected, confusing downstream users."
