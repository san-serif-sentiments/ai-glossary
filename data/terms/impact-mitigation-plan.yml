short_def: "Action plan that tracks risks, mitigations, owners, and timelines for an AI deployment."
long_def: >-
  An impact mitigation plan documents the risks identified during assessments, the mitigation steps the organization
  will take, and the owners accountable for each action. It connects findings from algorithmic impact assessments,
  red-team exercises, and audits to specific deadlines, metrics, and escalation triggers. Policy leads maintain the
  plan to satisfy regulatory expectations, product teams map mitigations to launch gates, and engineering tracks the
  technical work needed to close gaps. When kept current, the plan provides a single source of truth for audits and
  post-incident reviews. When neglected, risks stay unaddressed and stakeholders lose visibility into whether controls
  are actually landing.
audiences:
  exec: "Use the mitigation plan to monitor whether high-severity risks are closing before committing to launch dates."
  engineer: "Link each mitigation to backlog tickets and telemetry so progress stays measurable and auditable."
examples:
  do:
    - "Record status updates and evidence links for every mitigation before major launch reviews."
    - "Flag blocked mitigations with escalation paths and decision deadlines for leadership."
  dont:
    - "Let mitigation owners slip without documenting rationale or alternate controls."
    - "Track mitigations in private spreadsheets that governance teams cannot access."
