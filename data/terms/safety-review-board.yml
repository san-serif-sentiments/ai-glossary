  A safety review board brings together policy, legal, security, product, and engineering leaders to evaluate AI systems
  before deployment. The board reviews risk registers, assurance cases, evaluation results, and mitigation plans, then
  issues approvals or action items. It also monitors incidents, tracks mitigation follow-through, and ensures governance
  policies evolve with capabilities. Effective boards maintain charters, meeting cadences, and decision logs that feed
  back into assurance cases and executive reporting. Without a formal board, decisions may be made piecemeal, leaving
  organizations exposed to fragmented oversight and inconsistent accountability.
audiences:
  exec: "Empower a safety board with decision rights so responsibility for high-risk launches is explicit."
