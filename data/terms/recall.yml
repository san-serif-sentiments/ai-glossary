short_def: "Share of actual positives a model successfully identifies."
long_def: >-
  Recall measures how well a model finds all relevant cases by dividing true positives by the sum of true positives and false negatives. High recall is essential when missing a positive case is costly or dangerous, such as failing to flag offensive content or overlooking a critical defect. When teams adjust thresholds, recall often moves in the opposite direction of precision, so decision-makers must weigh acceptable trade-offs. Engineers analyze recall per subgroup to ensure equitable performance, while policy and product teams set recall targets aligned with risk appetite and regulatory requirements. Recall is commonly monitored in tandem with precision, F1 score, and confusion matrices to understand overall effectiveness.
audiences:
  exec: "Recall is how many of the real problems the AI actually catches."
  engineer: "TP / (TP + FN); evaluate recall across classes and user cohorts, and tune thresholds or sampling to meet coverage goals."
examples:
  do:
    - "Set minimum recall thresholds for safety-critical detections."
    - "Monitor recall daily to catch regressions caused by data drift."
  dont:
    - "Maximize recall without reviewing the spike in false positives."
    - "Report aggregate recall without subgroup breakdowns."
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
    - "validity"
    - "accountability"
  risk_notes: "Poor recall leaves high-risk events undetected, undermining safety promises and compliance obligations."
