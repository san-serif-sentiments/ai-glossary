short_def: "Standardized categories used to tag, analyze, and report AI incidents consistently."
long_def: >-
  An incident taxonomy defines the categories and severity levels used when logging AI failures or near misses. It enables
  consistent reporting across teams, trend analysis, and regulatory submissions. The taxonomy should map to policy
  commitments (e.g., privacy, bias, safety), specify severity criteria, and align with incident response playbooks.
  Policy teams maintain the taxonomy, engineering and support staff apply it during postmortems, and executives use the
  data to prioritize mitigations. Without a shared taxonomy, incident data becomes noisy, making it difficult to learn
  from patterns or demonstrate accountability to regulators.
audiences:
  exec: "Mandate taxonomy usage so incident trends inform roadmap and governance decisions."
  engineer: "Tag incidents accurately and link them to the taxonomy when filing postmortems."
examples:
  do:
    - "Review taxonomy definitions annually with policy and security stakeholders."
    - "Tie mitigation backlog items to taxonomy categories for tracking."
  dont:
    - "Let teams create ad hoc categories that fragment reporting."
    - "Ignore low-severity categories; they often reveal emerging risks."
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
    - "governance"
    - "monitoring"
    - "accountability"
  risk_notes: "Inconsistent classification hides systemic issues and complicates regulatory disclosure."
