  Data minimization limits the amount and duration of personal data collected, processed, or stored. Regulations such as GDPR and CCPA mandate this principle so organizations cannot hoard information “just in case.” In AI projects, minimization applies to training datasets, prompt logs, telemetry, and derived embeddings. Product teams collaborate with legal and security to define clear purposes, expiration timelines, and deletion workflows. Engineers implement technical controls such as field-level encryption, redaction, and retention policies. Adoption of data minimization reduces breach impact, compliance risk, and model bias stemming from unnecessary sensitive attributes. Documenting minimization choices is also a prerequisite for privacy impact assessments and external audits.
audiences:
  exec: "Data minimization keeps us from collecting more personal information than we need, reducing risk."
  engineer: "Implement least-data pipelines, redact sensitive fields, and enforce retention limits that map to documented business purposes."
examples:
  do:
    - "Align prompts and telemetry retention with published privacy notices."
    - "Automate deletion of training data that no longer supports the model’s purpose."
  dont:
    - "Copy entire databases into model pipelines without reviewing necessity."
    - "Keep user data after opt-outs or contract end dates."

  risk_notes: "Excess data increases breach exposure, drives regulatory penalties, and can introduce bias into models."
