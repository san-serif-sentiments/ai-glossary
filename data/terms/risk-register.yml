short_def: "Central list of identified AI risks, their owners, mitigations, and review status."
long_def: >-
  A risk register tracks every material risk an AI system poses, including potential harms, likelihood, impact, and planned
  mitigations. It links each item to an accountable owner, current status, and evidence such as evaluation results or
  assurance case references. Policy teams maintain the register for governance reviews, product owners prioritize fixes,
  engineering updates mitigation progress, and legal teams map entries to regulatory obligations. The register should be
  version-controlled and reviewed regularly; letting it go stale leaves leadership blind to emerging exposures.
audiences:
  exec: "Use the risk register as a single source of truth when approving launches or investments."
  engineer: "Update mitigation status promptly so policy partners can judge readiness accurately."
