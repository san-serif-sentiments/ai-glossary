  An agent executor is the control loop that wraps a language model with planning, tool routing, memory updates,
  and termination rules. It interprets the model's action plans, selects the right tool or retriever, enforces
  guardrails, and decides when the task is complete or needs human escalation. Mature executors persist interim
  state, log each decision for observability, and cap iteration budgets to avoid runaway loops. Product teams set
  policies for the executor about tool eligibility or human approval, while engineers own the orchestration logic
  that keeps the agent explainable and reversible. Without a disciplined executor, agent architectures tend to
  overrun budgets, trigger risky actions, or hide provenance needed for governance reviews.
audiences:
  exec: "Clarify what control layer governs autonomous workflows so you can scope approvals and accountability."
  engineer: "Treat the executor as orchestrator code: build deterministic plans, enforce stop criteria, and log every action."
examples:
  do:
    - "Cap the number of tool invocations per task and emit structured traces for monitoring."
    - "Define escalation triggers that halt the loop when confidence drops or policies flag sensitive data."
  dont:
    - "Let the agent call privileged tools without a permissions check in the executor."
    - "Ship an executor without human-readable logs or telemetry for audit reviews."

  risk_notes: "Unbounded loops or opaque routing decisions can create safety, compliance, and cost exposures."
