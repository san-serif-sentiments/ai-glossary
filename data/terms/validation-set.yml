  The validation set provides an unbiased checkpoint during model development. After fitting on the training data, teams
  gauge performance on this held-out split to choose architectures, hyperparameters, and stopping criteria. A disciplined
  validation strategy prevents information leakage into the final test set, offering a realistic signal of how design
  choices will play out in production. Product leaders rely on validation metrics to weigh accuracy against latency or cost
  trade-offs, while engineers track subgroup results to guard against bias. Clear documentation of validation protocol,
  refresh cadence, and governance sign-off keeps experiment logs reproducible and audit ready.
audiences:
  exec: "Validation data is the dress rehearsal that tells us if the model is ready before the final exam."
  engineer: "Keep validation slices immutable, monitor for drift, and reset them when feature space or labeling rules change."
examples:
  do:
    - "Log every hyperparameter trial that reads the validation set to maintain experiment lineage."
    - "Audit validation performance across protected cohorts before promoting a model."
  dont:
    - "Tune against the test set or stack multiple validations from overlapping data."
    - "Treat validation metrics as final sign-off without human review or business context."
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
    - "robustness"
    - "accountability"
  risk_notes: "Mismanaged validation data masks overfitting and governance gaps, leading to unexpected failures after launch."
