long_def: >-
  An AI circuit breaker detects abnormal behavior—such as rapid policy violations, runaway tool use, or anomalous
  telemetry—and stops the system from continuing without human approval. It can disable outputs, revoke tool permissions,
  or route all traffic to human agents. Security and engineering teams design detection logic, policy leaders set
  thresholds, and product teams coordinate user messaging. Circuit breakers complement escalation policies and incident
  response plans, providing a fast path to contain harm. Without them, incidents may escalate faster than humans can
  intervene manually.
audiences:
  exec: "Mandate circuit breakers for high-impact automations to cap worst-case scenarios."
  engineer: "Log activations, reasons, and resolution notes so the control remains auditable."
examples:
  do:
    - "Trigger a breaker if safety classifiers flag repeated violations within a session."
    - "Simulate breaker events during chaos exercises to ensure recovery paths work."
  dont:
    - "Leave breaker logic undocumented or dependent on a single engineer."
    - "Ignore alerts after a breaker fires; reset only after root cause analysis."
