long_def: >-
  Feature engineering covers the techniques used to convert raw logs, text, images, or structured records into inputs a
  model can learn from. It spans cleaning, normalization, aggregation, embedding, and generation of domain-specific
  indicators. Thoughtful feature engineering improves generalization, reduces noise, and encodes policy guardrails early in
  the pipeline. Data scientists prototype feature pipelines, engineers productionize them with monitoring and lineage, and
  product teams align feature choices with user journeys and governance constraints. Documented feature logic also
  accelerates audits and root cause analysis when behaviour shifts in production.
audiences:
  exec: "Feature engineering is how we turn messy data into reliable signals the model can use."
  engineer: "Version feature code, validate statistical drift, and partner with governance to review sensitive attributes."
examples:
  do:
    - "Log transformations and scaling choices alongside the model so they stay in sync across environments."
    - "Run fairness and privacy checks when introducing features derived from sensitive sources."
  dont:
    - "Ship handcrafted features without automated tests or lineage traces."
    - "Overfit by generating thousands of highly specific features with no regularization plan."
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
    - "data_quality"
    - "privacy"
  risk_notes: "Opaque feature pipelines hide bias, privacy violations, and drift triggers, making incidents harder to manage."
