  Fine-tuning continues training from a pretrained checkpoint using a curated dataset that reflects the target task, tone, or policy. By adjusting weights on top of broad foundation knowledge, teams achieve better accuracy and alignment than prompt engineering alone. Approaches include supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning from human feedback, parameter-efficient methods like LoRA, and combinations with synthetic data generation. Product leaders plan fine-tuning roadmaps to differentiate experiences or enforce brand voice, while engineers manage hyperparameters, data balancing, and evaluation suites to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Governance stakeholders scrutinize fine-tuning inputs for licensing, privacy, and bias risks, requiring documentation of provenance and review sign-offs. Because fine-tuned models can drift from base guarantees, organizations version checkpoints, run regression tests, and maintain rollback plans to satisfy compliance obligations and operational reliability.
audiences:
  exec: "Fine-tuning teaches a general model to speak in the organizationâ€™s voice and handle domain-specific tasks."
  engineer: "Continue training a pretrained model on labeled or preference data, tracking hyperparameters, evals, and release packaging."
examples:
