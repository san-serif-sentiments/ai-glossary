  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) combines information retrieval and text generation so
  that a model answers questions using relevant, up-to-date context instead of only relying on
  patterns memorized during pretraining. A retrieval component first decomposes the user query
  and searches a corpus—via sparse, dense, or hybrid methods—to surface the most relevant
  passages. Those passages are then packaged, often alongside metadata like source citations,
  and injected into the model prompt or context window prior to decoding. The approach reduces
  hallucinations, improves factual accuracy, and enables small models to compete with larger
  ones when grounded knowledge is more important than general fluency. Successful RAG systems
  invest in document chunking, embedding quality, reranking, and evaluation pipelines that
  monitor both retrieval recall and answer precision. Governance teams value RAG because it
  enables transparent sourcing and can encode organizational policies in the retrieval layer,
  but they also monitor for drift, stale content, and privacy leaks when sensitive documents are
  indexed.
audiences:
  exec: "Treat it as a guardrail: the system fetches trusted documents before the model speaks, so answers stay on-policy."
  engineer: "Pipeline = query rewriting, retriever (BM25, DPR, hybrid), reranker, and generator with retrieved context appended to the prompt."
examples:
  do:
    - "Version and monitor the document index so you can trace outputs back to specific sources."
    - "Evaluate retrieval recall and answer accuracy separately to isolate failure modes."
  dont:
    - "Assume RAG removes the need for model fine-tuning or ongoing evaluation."
    - "Index sensitive records without access controls or data minimization."
