  Embeddings map pieces of information—such as words, sentences, images, or audio—into dense vectors so similar concepts cluster in vector space. Modern foundation models learn embeddings during pretraining, optimizing them to capture contextual meaning, syntactic roles, and domain signals that make downstream tasks like retrieval, classification, and recommendation more effective. When teams build retrieval-augmented generation systems, they compute embeddings for documents and queries, then compare them with similarity metrics like cosine distance or dot product. The quality of those vectors influences whether the right context is retrieved, how well clustering and anomaly detection work, and how fast nearest-neighbor searches execute. Governance programs scrutinize embedding pipelines because biased or outdated vectors can encode harmful associations and propagate them into products. Maintaining embeddings thus requires dataset curation, versioning, and monitoring to detect drift as language or policies change.
