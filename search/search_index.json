memory updates, and termination rules. It interprets the model's action plans, selects the right tool or retriever, enforces guardrails, and decides when the task is complete or needs human escalation. Mature executors persist interim state, log each decision for observability, and cap iteration budgets to avoid runaway loops. Product teams set policies for the executor about tool eligibility or human approval, while engineers own the orchestration logic that keeps the agent explainable and reversible.
